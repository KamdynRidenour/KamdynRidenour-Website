        <div class="subheading mb-5">Theatre Major | Focused on Acting and Directing</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! I'm Kamdyn Ridenour, a theatre major with a strong passion for acting and directing. My journey in theatre has been quite a ride, filled with late-night rehearsals and lots of hard work. I've always been drawn to acting. It's not just about memorizing lines; it's about getting into the minds of different characters and exploring the vast range of human emotions. It's a lot of work, but the thrill of connecting with an audience and telling a great story is what makes it all worth it.<br><br>

        Not only have I partook in acting, but in directing as well. In high school I directed for our fall and spring musical production while I was also playing leads in them! At the same time I was working in a competition as well and directing freshmen for that competition all at the same time! I learned alot throguh directinga dn my experiences through acting definetily made me know how to take the role of a director and I just looked at things through the eyes of an actor as I tackled obstacles. Theatre is my way of expressing the complexity of human emotions and experiences, and I love how it can make people think and feel deeply. Besides theatre, I'm a big fan of jazz music; it's just got that smooth, soulful vibe that speaks to me. One of my all-time favorite movies is "La La Land." It's a fantastic film that combines my love for acting, jazz, and storytelling. It's a huge inspiration for me.<br><br>

        And then there's Dr. Pepper. It's my go-to drink. That unique flavor never fails to keep me going during those late-night rehearsals or study sessions.

In my downtime, I often find myself at the piano, creating some beautiful melodies that complement my love for the arts. I've also dabbled in guitar, just enough to strum a few chords and add a bit more musical flavor to my repertoire.

Looking ahead, I'm excited about the idea of sharing my knowledge and passion for theatre with others. Teaching and mentoring aspiring actors and directors is something I'm really looking forward to. Passing on the traditions and techniques of this art form is not just a responsibility but a joy.

So, whether I'm performing, directing, enjoying jazz, sipping Dr. Pepper, or making music on the piano and guitar, I'm pumped to be part of this fantastic and timeless world of theatre. Theatre has the power to change lives, challenge norms, and bring people together, and I'm stoked to be a part of this journey. The stage is my playground, and I can't wait to see what's in store for me next!
